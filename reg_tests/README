To run regression tests:

1) Build chgres_cube program.
2) Invoke driver script for your machine.  See script
   prolog for details.  Supported machines are:
   - Theia (driver.theia.sh)
   - WCOSS-Cray (driver.cray.sh)
   - WCOSS-Dell (driver.dell.sh)

A series of daisy-chained tests will run.  A test fails 
if the output files differ from the baseline as determined
by the 'nccmp' utility.

A summary of results will be in "summary.log".
